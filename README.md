## 🌟 Project Vision

FODO is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between food surplus and food scarcity in India by connecting food donors (individuals, restaurants, caterers, event organizers) with NGOs that distribute food to people in need.

## 📊 The Problem We're Solving

- **40% of food produced in India is wasted** (worth ₹92,000 crores annually)
- Weddings and events generate 40-50 kg of food waste on average
- **190 million people** go to bed hungry every night in India
- **14% of India's population** is undernourished
- No centralized platform to connect donors with NGOs efficiently

## 💡 Our Solution

FODO creates a digital bridge that:
- Allows donors to quickly post surplus food with photos and details
- Enables NGOs to discover and accept nearby food donations
- Provides real-time tracking and updates throughout the donation process
- Builds trust through transparency and confirmation systems
- Creates measurable social impact
