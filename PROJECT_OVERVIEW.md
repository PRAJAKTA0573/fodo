# FODO - Food Donation Bridge Application

## 🌟 Project Vision

FODO is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between food surplus and food scarcity in India by connecting food donors with organizations that distribute food to people in need.

---

## 📊 The Problem

### Current Situation in India

India faces a paradoxical situation where food wastage and hunger coexist:

1. **Massive Food Wastage**
   - Weddings generate an average of 40-50 kg of food waste
   - Parties and special events discard substantial amounts of edible food
   - Corporate events, hotels, and restaurants dispose of surplus food daily
   - An estimated 40% of food produced in India is wasted
   - Annual food waste worth ₹92,000 crores

2. **Widespread Hunger**
   - Over 190 million people go to bed hungry every night
   - 14% of India's population is undernourished
   - Children suffer from malnutrition affecting their development
   - Daily wage workers and homeless people struggle for meals
   - Many NGOs lack efficient systems to collect surplus food

3. **Missing Connection**
   - No centralized platform to connect donors with NGOs
   - Lack of trust and transparency in donation process
   - Donors unsure if their food reaches the needy
   - NGOs struggle to find consistent food sources
   - Time-sensitive nature of food makes coordination difficult

---

## 💡 The Solution

FODO creates a **digital bridge** that connects surplus food with hungry people through a transparent, efficient, and trustworthy mobile platform.

### How FODO Works

```
DONOR → Creates Request → NGO Views → NGO Accepts → Food Pickup → Distribution → Confirmation
```

### Key Stakeholders

1. **Donors** (Food Providers)
   - Individuals hosting events (weddings, parties, celebrations)
   - Restaurants with surplus food
   - Caterers after events
   - Event organizers
   - Hotels and banquet halls
   - Corporate cafeterias

2. **NGOs/Organizations** (Food Distributors)
   - Registered non-profit organizations
   - Food banks
   - Community kitchens
   - Social welfare groups
   - Charitable trusts
   - Volunteer organizations

### Core Value Proposition

- **For Donors**: Easy way to contribute to society, reduce guilt of waste, build social responsibility
- **For NGOs**: Reliable food source, efficient collection system, better service to beneficiaries
- **For Society**: Reduced food waste, fight against hunger, stronger community bonds
