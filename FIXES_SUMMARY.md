# FODO App - Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

### Issue #1: Location Permission Crash (FIXED)
**Problem:** App was crashing when user clicked "Allow" on location permission dialog.

**Root Cause:** Infinite recursive function calls in permission handling code.

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `lib/core/utils/permission_helper.dart` - Fixed recursive `openAppSettings()` call
- ✅ `lib/services/location_service.dart` - Added namespace import to avoid conflicts
- ✅ `lib/features/donor/presentation/pages/location_picker_page.dart` - Added proper error handling

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - See `LOCATION_PERMISSION_FIX.md` for details

### Issue #2: Google Maps API Key Missing (CONFIGURED)
**Problem:** App crashes with "API key not found" error.

**Root Cause:** Google Maps API key was not configured in the app.

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added API key placeholder (line 61-64)
- ✅ `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` - Added GMSServices configuration (line 11-12)

**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS YOUR ACTION** - You need to add your actual Google Maps API key

## Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Where do I get the API key?**
A: https://console.cloud.google.com/ > APIs & Services > Credentials

**Q: Do I need to pay for Google Maps API?**
A: No, Google provides $200 free credit per month, which is more than enough for development and testing.

**Q: Can I use the same API key for Android and iOS?**
A: Yes, but for better security, it's recommended to create separate keys with platform-specific restrictions.

**Q: How do I know if the API key is working?**
A: Run `./check_setup.sh` and then `flutter run`. If maps display without errors, it's working!

**Q: What if I see "For development purposes only" on the map?**
A: This means billing is not enabled. Enable it in Google Cloud Console (you won't be charged for development usage).

### Still Having Issues?

1. Check `SETUP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API.md` for detailed troubleshooting
2. Run `./check_setup.sh` to verify configuration
3. Check the console logs for specific error messages
4. Make sure you enabled the correct APIs in Google Cloud Console

## Final Notes

- **Security:** Don't commit your API keys to git. Add them to `.gitignore`.
- **Free Tier:** You get 28,000 map loads free per month - plenty for development!
- **Testing:** Test on a real device for best results with location features.
- **Documentation:** Keep these markdown files for future reference.
