# Donation Status Flow - Donor & NGO Interaction

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

Your app **already implements exactly what you described**! Here's how it works:

## Donation Lifecycle

### 1. **Donor Creates Donation**
**Location:** `DonorDashboardPage` → Tap "New Donation" FAB → `CreateDonationPage`

**Initial Status:** `DonationStatus.created`
- Status shown to donor: **"Created"** (Blue color)
- Not yet visible to NGOs

**Then automatically changes to:** `DonationStatus.visible`
- Status shown to donor: **"Available"** (Blue color)
- Now visible to NGOs for acceptance

---

### 2. **Donor Views Their Donation**
**Locations where donor can see donations:**

#### A. **Donor Dashboard** (`DonorDashboardPage`)
- Shows "Active Donations" section
- Shows "Recent Donations" section
- Each donation card displays:
  - Food type and description
  - Creation date/time
  - **Status chip** with color coding

#### B. **Donation History** (`DonationHistoryPage`)
- Shows ALL donations with filters
- Status filter options available
- Search functionality
- Each card shows current status

#### C. **Donation Details** (`DonationDetailsPage`)
- Full details of the donation
- **Large status banner** at top showing current status
- Timeline showing all status changes with timestamps

**Status Display:**
```dart
// Colors shown to donor:
- Created/Available → Blue chip "Available"
- Accepted → Orange chip "Accepted" ✅
- In Transit → Orange chip "On the Way"
- Collected → Purple chip "Collected"
- Distributed → Purple chip "Distributed"
- Completed → Green chip "Completed"
```

---

### 3. **NGO Side - View Available Donations**
**Location:** `NGODashboardPage` → "Available Donations" → `AvailableDonationsPage`

**What NGOs See:**
- All donations with status `visible` (Available)
- Filter by:
  - Food type
  - Distance
  - Search
- Sort by:
  - Distance (nearest first)
  - Time (newest first)
  - Quantity (most people fed first)

---

### 4. **NGO Views Donation Details**
**Location:** `DonationDetailsNGOPage`

**What NGOs See:**
- Complete donation details
- Food photos (if enabled)
- Pickup location with map
- Donor contact info
- **"Accept This Donation" button** (Green) at bottom

---

### 5. **NGO Accepts Donation** ✅
**Action:** NGO taps "Accept This Donation" button

**Process:**
1. Dialog appears: "When can you collect this donation?"
2. NGO selects estimated pickup time (date + time picker)
3. Taps "Confirm"
4. Status updates to `DonationStatus.accepted`
5. NGO info is saved to donation record

**Backend:** `NGOProvider.acceptDonation()` → `NGORepository.acceptDonation()`

**What Updates:**
- Donation status → `accepted`
- NGO info added:
  - NGO name
  - Contact person
  - Contact phone
  - Estimated pickup time
- Timeline updated with "acceptedAt" timestamp

---

### 6. **Donor Sees "Accepted" Status** ✅

After NGO accepts, donor sees:

#### On Dashboard:
- Status chip changes to **"Accepted"** (Orange color)

#### On Donation Details Page:
- Status banner shows **"Accepted"** (Orange)
- New section appears: **"Accepted By"** showing:
  - NGO name (e.g., "Food Bank India")
  - Contact person name
  - Phone number
  - Estimated pickup time
- Timeline shows "Accepted" entry with timestamp

**Example Display:**
```

| `visible` | 🔵 Blue | "Available" | Visible to NGOs |
| `accepted` | 🟠 Orange | "Accepted" | NGO accepted, pending pickup |
| `inTransit` | 🟠 Orange | "On the Way" | NGO traveling to pickup |
| `collected` | 🟣 Purple | "Collected" | NGO collected food |
| `distributed` | 🟣 Purple | "Distributed" | Food given to beneficiaries |
| `completed` | 🟢 Green | "Completed" | Donation complete |
| `cancelled` | 🔴 Red | "Cancelled" | Cancelled by donor |
| `expired` | ⚪ Grey | "Expired" | Expired (48 hours) |

---

## Real-time Updates ⚡

**Donor can listen to status changes in real-time:**
- `DonationProvider.listenToDonation(donationId)` - Single donation
- `DonationProvider.listenToDonations(donorId)` - All donations

When NGO accepts, donor's screen **automatically updates** without refresh!

3. See list of donations with "Available" status
4. Tap on a donation to view details
5. Review food details, location, donor info

## Features Already Working ✅

- ✅ Donor creates donation → Status: "Created" → "Available"
- ✅ NGO sees all available donations
- ✅ NGO can accept/reject donation
- ✅ Donor sees "Accepted" status when NGO accepts
- ✅ Donor sees NGO details after acceptance
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Timeline tracking all status changes

## Optional: Add Reject Functionality

Currently, NGOs can only **accept** donations. If you want to add **reject** functionality:

### Option 1: Silent rejection (NGO just doesn't accept)
- No action needed - donation expires after 48 hours if not accepted

### Option 2: Explicit rejection with reason
Would need to add:
1. "Reject" button on NGO details page
2. Rejection reason dialog
3. New status: `rejected` in enum
4. Update donation with rejection info
5. Show rejection status to donor

Let me know if you want me to implement explicit rejection!
